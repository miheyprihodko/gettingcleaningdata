Our dataset contains 66 variables. Two of them - activity and subject - characterises test conditions.

Other 64 variables described by its name, where:

- timedomain/frequencydomain - measurements of time domain signals or frequency domain signals
- accelerometer and gyroscope - source of signal
- body and gravity - acceleration signal was then separated into these types of signals
- jerk - Jerk signals received from body linear acceleration and angular velocity derived 
- magnitude - a magnitude of three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm
- x, y, z - one dimension of signal
- meanvalue, standartdeviation - type of statistic caluclated for the appropriate type of measurements

Values of the dataset respresent means of means and standart deviations of 64 measurement for the appropriate activity and subject types.
